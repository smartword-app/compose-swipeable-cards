/**
 * Configuration for calculation factors that affect card behavior in SwipeableCards.
 *
 * @property rotationFactor Lambda that calculates the card rotation angle based on the current offset.
 *                         The default implementation provides a natural-feeling rotation during swipes,
 *                         dividing the x-offset by 50 to determine the rotation in degrees.
 *
 * @property scaleFactor Lambda that calculates the scaling factor for each card in the stack.
 *                       This allows for dynamic resizing of cards based on their index, state, or properties.
 *                       The default implementation keeps all cards at the same scale (1f).
 *
 * @property cardOffsetCalculation Lambda that calculates the position offset for each card in the stack.
 *                                Takes the card index, state, and properties as parameters.
 *                                The default implementation creates a cascading stack effect by:
 *                                - Calculating vertical and horizontal offsets based on the cardâ€™s position from the top
 *                                - Using the `stackedCardsOffset` property to determine spacing between cards
 *                                - Adjusting the offset relative to the currently visible card (`currentCardIndex`)
